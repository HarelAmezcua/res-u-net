# 🧠 U-Net Image Segmentation from Scratch

A clean and modular implementation of the **U-Net architecture** for semantic segmentation tasks using **PyTorch**. Designed to deliver accurate segmentation of complex image structures—ideal for applications such as medical imaging, object detection, and remote sensing.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository presents a U-Net model built entirely from scratch, with a focus on:

- Precision in object boundary detection
- Robust data augmentation using **Albumentations**
- Clean modular structure suitable for research or production
- Easy-to-understand notebooks for experimentation

## 🔍 Example Usage

Below is a simplified snippet demonstrating how to train the model using the implemented pipeline:

```python
from src.model import UNet
from src.train import train_model
from src.dataset import CustomDataset

# Load dataset
train_dataset = CustomDataset(image_dir='data/images', mask_dir='data/masks', augment=True)

# Initialize model
model = UNet(in_channels=3, out_channels=1)

# Train the model
train_model(model, train_dataset, epochs=25, lr=1e-4)
````
